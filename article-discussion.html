				<p class="pt-2">Different methods of visualizing survey data based on result type:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Binary Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Survey questions that offer two binary options (i.e. A or B, Yes or no…) should utilize a pie chart to display its results. If there are multiple result groups, then using a single bar chart would be the way to go compared to the inefficient method of using multiple pie charts for comparison.</p>
				<ol start="2">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Rating Scale Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Rating scale results differ from binary results in that they display a wide spectrum of data. These survey types often represent the extent of attitude of the respondent/participant, as their answer may not be as straightforward or simplistic as a binary answer. The best way to represent rating scale results are 100% stacked bar charts. These charts will accurately depict the results in relation to their proportions as a whole. It would be beneficial as well to compress such data into fewer, simpler categories to allow a clearer representation of data in the charts.</p>
				<ol start="3">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Demographic Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Demographic results could possibly include information about the respondents age, income, gender, ethnicity…etc. One of the methods of visualizing demographic results is using a choropleth map, where the different extents or scales of data are represented using different shades of color. This is more beneficial when attempting to display information relating to a specific geographic region. Other ways of displaying demographic results could be using histograms or icon charts.</p>
				<ol start="4">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Open-ended Comments</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Open-ended comments refer to results that require respondents to craft their unique responses in their own words. Therefore, each individual respondent provides a completely unique response, which makes visualizing the responses in its entirety extremely difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to categorize as many responses as possible, thus allowing the volume of the responses to be reduced to a level that can be displayed easily. Word clouds are one way to visualize such qualitative data without too much analytical effort. However, one may also choose to analyze all the qualitative data responses and categorize them into groups that can be then transferred onto a bar chart.</p>
				<ol start="5">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Multiple Choice Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Multiple choice answers are relatively easier to display visually because it is already grouped into categories, as the respondents are already given answers they must choose. The best way to display multiple choice answers is using bar charts again.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Significance:</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">This article provides us with a better understanding of what visual methods correlate with what type of data we collect. This information would benefit our website by showing us how we can utilize visual stimuli to provide the user with a more efficient and effective way of understanding our data. This article would also help us structure our site and its design in a way that will utilize the best possible way to present our findings. We would also be able to ensure that we use the correct formatting for the graphs and charts in our website, eliminating confusing or inappropriate graphs and charts that may be invaluable to our user.</p>

				<p class="indent pt-2 lh-2">The document provides an overview of different kinds of graphs and tips on how to present them (“Presenting statistical information – Graphs” [PSI-G], 2015).</p>
				<p class="lh-2">Main communication principles of graph use:
					<ul>
						<li>Exact numeric details are not essential</li>
						<li>Tendency is demonstrated</li>
						<li>Show the relationship between data values</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="lh-2">Graph Formatting is the first step to readers to understand presented data.
					<ol class="lh-2">
						<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Labels.</span> Titles should summarise main information shown in the graph mentioning variables. They are usually placed in the center, above or below the graphical data. Additionally, briefly describe x and y axis labels (horizontal and vertical) to show a unit of measurement. For example, it can be kilograms, number of items, percentages, etc. Also add legends and footnotes that will help users to understand data in detail.</li>
						<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Start axes with 0</span> to avoid misinterpretation. An exception to this rule is when negative values are presented in a graph.</li>
						<li>Graphs generally present estimated results when describing data gathered from a sample. Therefore, the presented data should be generalized to population data carefully. Thus, confidence intervals should be indicated by the use of error bars. They show “statistically significant difference between any estimates” and suggest a <span class="font-weight-bold">level of confidence</span> (PSI-G, 2015).</li>
						<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Bars that show categories should not overlap.</span></li>
						<li>The last and the most important rule – <span class="font-weight-bold">less is more.</span> Graphs should be simplified and present only essential information that will be important to readers. Present data only as two-dimensional (2D) to avoid misinterpretation. Do not overuse colors and apply them consistently. The graph should be readable and understandable when printed in black and white.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">The choice of graphs highly depends on the type of data presented. For categorical data use bar graphs, clustered bar graphs and stacked column charts. Ordinal data is best described with bar graphs and histograms. Use line graphs and scatter plots for continuous data. For interval data use bar graphs, histograms and box-whisker plots.</p>

				<h1 class="display-4 border-bottom pb-2">Presenting Data in Tables and Charts <a class="h1 btn btn-link" target="_blank" title="Visit the Article!" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/abd1806-4841.20143388"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></h1>
				<p class="indent pt-2 lh-2">The presentation of data is important as it is a key component to data analysis and leads to other research and publications. Organizing data into a graph or table can help reveal patterns and highlight differences between the variables being compared.</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">The values in the tables and graphs should be consistent and standardized in the number of decimal places. A title should always be included to label what data is being shown as well as where the data was taken from. Appropriate legends must always be included to allow for proper identification of each variable being displayed. Variables measured on a numerical scale regardless of if it is discrete or continuous can provide higher quality information and should preferred for statistical analysis.</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Graphical data should only be presented on a document after being mentioned in the text in order to provide context for the data. Graph axes should always be labelled and a quotation for the source from which the information was taken from in necessary.</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Every table and graph should be self-explanatory – readers should be able to understandable and comprehend the data without reading and of the text that it is referring to. When displaying data on a graph or table, you should show as much of the actual data as possible and avoid summarizing by using means and variances.</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">It is important to consider displaying absolute frequency (actual numbers), relative frequency (percentage values of frequency for each category) as well as cumulative frequency (in order to display cumulative values for multiple categories). Each of these methods of displaying frequencies provide different perspectives on understanding the data.</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Bar plots are not ideal for every scenario although it provides a good general overview of all of the data. The main issue with bar plots is that they only display summary statistics, the raw data and the distribution are hidden. Furthermore, bar charts are not able to effectively show outliers, bimodality and unequal sample sizes since it is based on summary statistics. This can cause the data to easily be mispresented as well as misinterpreted since extremely different data sets can produce the exact same bar chart.</p>

				<h1 class="display-4 border-bottom pb-2">Reporting Quantitative Results <a class="h1 btn btn-link" target="_blank" title="Visit the Article!" href="http://virg.vanderbilt.edu/assessmentplans/results/Reporting_Results_Quantitative.aspx"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></h1>
				<p class="indent pt-2 lh-2">This article provides an overview on how to present survey results and data in a unique and simple fashion. It mainly focuses on simplifying the info, the various ways one can organize the information depending on the type of graph, making it easy to understand to the reader, therefore allowing the data to be much more impactful and interesting to read.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">General tips:</p>
				<p class="indent">
					<ol class="lh-2">
						<li>In general, tables are better than graphs when presenting structured numeric information.
							Graphs are more useful in terms of comparing data, trends and showing relationships. By doing so, it would prevent the user from being confused or mislead by the information presented.
						</li>
						<li>When decimals are used, it is important that they remain consistent in terms of the
							amount of digits. Otherwise, it would look unprofessional, more difficult to understand, and finally more difficult for calculations.
						</li>
						<li>Tables and graphs should be simple to understand and self explanatory. The reader
							should not be required to read the text for more context to understand the data presented. Ensure the title is informative, with all the rows, columns and axes clearly labeled. If a table presented does not strengthen the discussion related to the main topic, it should not be included.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Pie Charts:</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Pie charts have limited utility, so they should only be presented to show parts of a whole (to equal 100%). Due to this, they do not make small differences apparent as pie charts only emphasize on large differences. Also, in order to avoid clutter of data, pie charts should only have a few “slices” and should be presented in 2D, as 3D can make the data confusing and misleading. Finally, colour is of great importance in pie charts, so ensure that colours are used wisely and are easy to differentiate from each other.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Bar Graphs:</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Bar graphs are the most effective when used for direct comparisons with other data, especially when compared to pie charts. A valuable tip is to ensure the bar graph begins with 0 as a baseline if there are only positive integers. However, if there are negative integers as well then 0 should be used as the midpoint. Again, alike to pie graphs, 3D effects should not be used as it can distort the look of the data presented. Finally, one should try to avoid stacked graphs as they are ineffective and more difficult to comprehend compared to clutter graphs. Clutter graphs present data side by side rather than on being stacked on top of each other, allowing much more simple comparisons.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Line Graphs:</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Line graphs are the most effective when used for presenting time series data. Especially when compared to bar graphs, line graphs are more effective when presenting a great quantity of data points, however is less effective in showing emphasis on differences for shorter periods of time. Also, ensure the lines are well separated when using multiple lines to avoid confusion and clutter, with different colours  and styles being used effectively to easily distinguish the lines.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Tables:</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Tables are the most effective way to present information for reference purposes. Everything should be clearly labeled and simple to understand since they are the most effective way to present data in general. Also, one should consider percentages over raw numbers as it summarizes the data more effectively and makes it easier to relate to other data given the context. Not only that, but the data should be presented in an order that makes sense rather than being random, such as the data with most value to the least value. Finally, a table should draw attention to its most important points. To do so, use different fonts and styles such as bold, italics, and different colours to draw more attention to the necessary information.</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Altogether, using the tips above, the different types of graphs should be considered depending on the type of information presented. By doing so, it allows for much more effective comprehension of the data. Otherwise, if the wrong type of graph is used for a specific data set, it may lead to undesired results and findings that could have been prevented.</p>
