				<p class="pt-2">Different methods of visualizing survey data based on result type:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Binary Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Survey questions that offer two binary options (i.e. A or B, Yes or no…) should utilize a pie chart to display its results. If there are multiple result groups, then using a single bar chart would be the way to go compared to the inefficient method of using multiple pie charts for comparison.</p>
				<ol start="2">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Rating Scale Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Rating scale results differ from binary results in that they display a wide spectrum of data. These survey types often represent the extent of attitude of the respondent/participant, as their answer may not be as straightforward or simplistic as a binary answer. The best way to represent rating scale results are 100% stacked bar charts. These charts will accurately depict the results in relation to their proportions as a whole. It would be beneficial as well to compress such data into fewer, simpler categories to allow a clearer representation of data in the charts.</p>
				<ol start="3">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Demographic Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Demographic results could possibly include information about the respondents age, income, gender, ethnicity…etc. One of the methods of visualizing demographic results is using a choropleth map, where the different extents or scales of data are represented using different shades of color. This is more beneficial when attempting to display information relating to a specific geographic region. Other ways of displaying demographic results could be using histograms or icon charts.</p>
				<ol start="4">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Open-ended Comments</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Open-ended comments refer to results that require respondents to craft their unique responses in their own words. Therefore, each individual respondent provides a completely unique response, which makes visualizing the responses in its entirety extremely difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to categorize as many responses as possible, thus allowing the volume of the responses to be reduced to a level that can be displayed easily. Word clouds are one way to visualize such qualitative data without too much analytical effort. However, one may also choose to analyze all the qualitative data responses and categorize them into groups that can be then transferred onto a bar chart.</p>
				<ol start="5">
					<li class="font-weight-bold">Multiple Choice Results</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="indent lh-2">Multiple choice answers are relatively easier to display visually because it is already grouped into categories, as the respondents are already given answers they must choose. The best way to display multiple choice answers is using bar charts again.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Significance:</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">This article provides us with a better understanding of what visual methods correlate with what type of data we collect. This information would benefit our website by showing us how we can utilize visual stimuli to provide the user with a more efficient and effective way of understanding our data. This article would also help us structure our site and its design in a way that will utilize the best possible way to present our findings. We would also be able to ensure that we use the correct formatting for the graphs and charts in our website, eliminating confusing or inappropriate graphs and charts that may be invaluable to our user.</p>

				<p class="indent pt-2 lh-2">The document provides an overview of different kinds of graphs and tips on how to present them (“Presenting statistical information – Graphs” [PSI-G], 2015).</p>
				<p class="lh-2">Main communication principles of graph use:
					<ul>
						<li>Exact numeric details are not essential</li>
						<li>Tendency is demonstrated</li>
						<li>Show the relationship between data values</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="lh-2">Graph Formatting is the first step to readers to understand presented data.
					<ol class="lh-2">
						<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Labels.</span> Titles should summarise main information shown in the graph mentioning variables. They are usually placed in the center, above or below the graphical data. Additionally, briefly describe x and y axis labels (horizontal and vertical) to show a unit of measurement. For example, it can be kilograms, number of items, percentages, etc. Also add legends and footnotes that will help users to understand data in detail.</li>
						<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Start axes with 0</span> to avoid misinterpretation. An exception to this rule is when negative values are presented in a graph.</li>
						<li>Graphs generally present estimated results when describing data gathered from a sample. Therefore, the presented data should be generalized to population data carefully. Thus, confidence intervals should be indicated by the use of error bars. They show “statistically significant difference between any estimates” and suggest a <span class="font-weight-bold">level of confidence</span> (PSI-G, 2015).</li>
						<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Bars that show categories should not overlap.</span></li>
						<li>The last and the most important rule – <span class="font-weight-bold">less is more.</span> Graphs should be simplified and present only essential information that will be important to readers. Present data only as two-dimensional (2D) to avoid misinterpretation. Do not overuse colors and apply them consistently. The graph should be readable and understandable when printed in black and white.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p class="indent lh-2">The choice of graphs highly depends on the type of data presented. For categorical data use bar graphs, clustered bar graphs and stacked column charts. Ordinal data is best described with bar graphs and histograms. Use line graphs and scatter plots for continuous data. For interval data use bar graphs, histograms and box-whisker plots.</p>
